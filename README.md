<h3> Netflix Movies and TV Shows Unsupervised  Machine Learning </h3> 
<h2>Project description:<br></h2>
<h2>The Netflix Movies and TV Shows Unsupervised Machine Learning project sought to delve 
into the vast Netflix dataset, leveraging advanced analytics to extract meaningful insights. 
The primary objectives included understanding content availability trends, exploring patterns 
through clustering, and implementing a content-based recommender system for enhanced 
user experience. 
Problem Statement 
This dataset, sourced from Flixable, encompasses Netflix's catalog of TV shows and movies 
up to the year 2019. Our objectives include: 
1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): 
 Analyzing and extracting insights from the dataset. 
 Identifying patterns, trends, and statistical characteristics. 
2. Understanding Content Availability Across Countries: 
 Investigating the distribution of content types in different countries. 
 Gaining insights into the regional preferences for TV shows and movies. 
3. Trend Analysis: 
 Assessing whether Netflix has shifted its focus towards producing more TV 
shows compared to movies in recent years. 
 Examining any discernible trends in the content mix. 
4. Clustering Similar Content: 
 Utilizing text-based features to cluster similar content. 
 Applying clustering algorithms to group TV shows and movies with 
comparable characteristics. 
Through these analyses, we aim to unveil key insights into Netflix's content strategy, regional 
variations, and the evolving landscape of its offerings.</h2>
